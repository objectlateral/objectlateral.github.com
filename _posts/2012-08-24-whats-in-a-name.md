The Proverbs say that a good name is rather to be chosen than great riches, so I was quite excited when I obtained ObjectLateral.com from the gracious guys at [Bocoup][bocoup].

What does it mean? Nothing concrete, that's for sure.

It's a combination of [Object Literal][object-literal] (a foundational building block in object-oriented software) and [Lateral thinking][lateral-thinking] (solving problems using creative or indirect approaches).

I came up with this name on my own, but I was not the first one.

Back in 2009, [Rick Waldron][rwaldron] and [Boaz Sender][boazsender] wrote an entire joke library called ObjectLateral.js after a fortunate typo in the jQuery Conf program (Boaz has the details [here][bocoup-ol-blog]).

It just so happens that I had met Boaz and Rick at another jQuery Conference. When I realized it was them that owned the domain and that it was no longer in use, I reached out to see if I could buy it from them.

Boaz refused to sell it to me. He insisted on gifting it to me! How awesome is that?

The spirit of ObjectLateral.js lives on at its new home: [http://boazsender.github.com/ObjectLateralJS/][objectlateral-js]
