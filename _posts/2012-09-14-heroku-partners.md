I have been a long time fan of [Heroku][heroku]. In fact, I wrote a [blog post][heroku-game-changer] all the way back in 2009 about why I thought Heroku was a game changer.

Well, the game has been changed and [Platforms as Services][paas] now abound. Heroku has gone from burgeoning startup to established player. So established, in fact, that they now have their very own [Partners program][heroku-partners].

What's a Heroku Partner? It is a hand picked service provider that is knowledgeable about the Heroku platform. Having deployed Rack, Sinatra, Rails, and Node.js applications to Heroku makes me a natural fit.

Happily, Object Lateral's application for partnership was accepted and we're now officially [part of the program][ol-partner-page].

It also looks like we're the first one in the region. Not too shabby!
