It _Turned Out_ that the new office has a perfect spot for a dart board. It also _Turned Out_ that I had an old dart board in the garage. It also _Turned Out_ that my friends at [Reify Design][reify] had a pretty cool idea about a custom dartboard cabinet.

What followed from this series of _Turned Outs_ is best described with pics:

_Finally_, we have a way to pick our next client-side JavaScript framework.
