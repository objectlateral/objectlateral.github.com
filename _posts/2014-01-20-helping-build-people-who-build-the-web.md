title: "Helping Build People Who Build the Web"
subtitle: "with Interface"

As a service provider to companies that engage the web[^1], I have seen the massive demand for web-related skills first-hand.

This need was so obvious to me, in fact, that I began advising young people with whom I'm associated[^2] that web-related skills are something they ought to equip themselves with before they enter the work force.

I wasn't the only one who noticed the problem.

Mark Hasebrook and Beth Engel of [Dundee VC][dundee] &mdash; which invests heavily in technology companies &mdash; as well as Jake Stutzman and Seth Carlson of [Elevate][elevate] &mdash; which employs and works with technical people &mdash; saw the need to fill the web-talent gap during the inaugural group of Mark's [Staight Shot][straight-shot] Accelerator[^3] last Summer. Then they decided to do something about it.

When they reached out to me about the possibility of teaching at a web school in Omaha, I leapt at the opportunity.

I feel like I've been teaching ever since I had something to contribute. I love, love, love that moment when I've helped a light turn on inside somebody's head.

## Announcing Interface

I'm super excited to impart to others the hard-earned web knowledge I've accumulated over the years. With that, I'm happy to announce [Interface: The Web Shool][interface].

[<img src="/images/posts/interface-banner.png" alt="Interface: The Web School" width="425" height="175">][interface]

Interface's mission is to build people who build the web, and I couldn't be more excited at the opportunity and challenge of helping realize that mission.

## What kind of people?

Interface is designed to be super flexible so we can help a wide range of individuals. Whereever you are in your personal goals or professional career, we want to meet you there and enable you to level up your skills.

No previous web skills are required to enroll, but my classes will not be a walk in the park. Students will need to be self-motivated and willing to dive in and immerse themselves in the material. Not sure if Interface is for you? <a href="mailto:jerod@interfaceschool.com">Get in touch</a> and we can find out together.

## What about Object Lateral?

Don't worry, Object Lateral isn't going anywhere.

I *will* have reduced bandwidth while classes are in session[^4], but I am not closing down Object Lateral and I believe that in the long-term my work with Interface will help make Object Lateral even better.

[^1]: this is rapidly becoming all companies, or all relevant ones, at least

[^2]: mostly through family and my local church

[^3]: which I was proud to see my brother Mike's [Crateful][crateful] participate in

[^4]: Web dev classes are 1pm-5pm daily, which means flexibility for students and instructors alike. The Spring session [is online][interface-schedule] for you to check out and share.
