title: "Helping Build People Who Build the Web"
subtitle: "with Interface"
---

As a service provider to companies that engage the web[^1], I have seen the massive demand for web-related skills first-hand.

This need was so obvious to me, in fact, that I began advising young people with whom I'm associated[^2] that web-related skills are something they ought to equip themselves with before they enter the work force.

I wasn't the only one who noticed the problem.

Mark Hasebrook and Beth Engel of [Dundee VC][dundee] &mdash; which invests heavily in technology companies &mdash; as well as Jake Stutzman and Seth Carlson of [Elevate][elevate] &mdash; which employs and works with technical people &mdash; saw the need to fill the web-talent gap during the inaugural group of Mark's [Staight Shot][straight-shot] Accelerator[^3] last Summer. Then they decided to do something about it.

When they reached out to me about the possibility of teaching at a web school in Omaha, I leapt at the opportunity.

I feel like I've been teaching ever since I had something to contribute. I love, love, love that moment when I've helped a light turn on inside somebody's head.

## Announcing Interface

I'm super excited to impart to others the hard-earned web knowledge I've accumulated over the years. With that, I'm happy to announce [Interface: The Web School][interface].

[<img src="/images/posts/interface-banner.png" alt="Interface: The Web School" width="425" height="175">][interface]

Interface's mission is to build people who build the web, and I couldn't be more excited at the opportunity and challenge of helping realize that mission.

## What kind of people?

Interface is designed to be super flexible so we can help a wide range of individuals. Whereever you are with your personal goals or professional career, we want to meet you there and *enable you* to level up.

No previous web skills are required to enroll, but my classes will not be a walk in the park. Students will need to be self-motivated and willing to dive in and immerse themselves in the material. Not sure if Interface is for you? <a href="mailto:jerod@interfaceschool.com">Get in touch</a> and we can find out together.

## What about Object Lateral?

Don't worry, Object Lateral isn't going anywhere.

I *will* have reduced bandwidth while classes are in session[^4], but I am not closing down Object Lateral and I believe that in the long-term my work with Interface will help make Object Lateral even better.

[^1]: this is rapidly becoming all companies, or all relevant ones, at least

[^2]: mostly through family and my local church

[^3]: which I was proud to see my brother Mike's [Crateful][crateful] participate in

[^4]: Web dev classes are 1pm-5pm daily, which means flexibility for students and instructors alike. The Spring session [is online][interface-schedule] for you to check out and share.
