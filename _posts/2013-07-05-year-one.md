It's hard for me to believe, but it's already been a year since I opened the proverbial (and quite virtual) doors to Object Lateral.

These first twelve months couldn't have gone much better. I was able to work with great clients (both new & old), to collaborate with some really sharp people, and to learn a ton as both a developer and business man.

One of my favorite things about running this business &mdash; besides being able to organize everything around my family's needs &mdash; is just how open the possibilities are. I truly do not know what the next year holds, but if it's anything like the last, it's going to be a great ride.

Here's to year two!
